HOW TO LOAD THE VOICEBANKS ON UTAU:
-------------------------------
1-Load an UST or make a new Project file
2-Go to Project tab, then press Project Property
3-Click the 3 dots at the right of the path that appears on a text box
4-Go to the directory of the voice you want to use
5-Select any .wav inside the folder
6-It should be loaded! press OK for close the Window
Now you already have the Voicebank loaded!!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------------
>Maybe you're asking "My UST/Song sounds muted on some notes!!"
  -Remember that you need to have a Romaji CV UST, if you already have one, try change the notes to any of the .wav's (a, e, i, o, u). Sometimes UTAU can't load the oto.ini correctly.

>Some VoiceBanks like Pico and Monster needs to be lowed 2 octaves so they can sound normal, for do that follow this guide:

  -Go to the "Edit" menu (In UTAU, ofc)
  -Select "Move Region by Property"
 (The next you need to know about the piano roll, but you can put the number without knowing that. Expect getting it wrong) 
  -If the notes of your midi/UST project are between C3 and C4, put -24 on the box, but if the notes are between C2 and C3, put -12
  -Press OK
 The notes are now octaves lower! press play for see if Pico and Monster now sounds good!

>With the same guide of before you can also do with male voices like Whitty
  -Whitty uses 1 octave lower, so move -12

>Skid and Pump have the same voice provideer but different between South and Spookeez
  -so i put Spookez as Skid and South as Pump
